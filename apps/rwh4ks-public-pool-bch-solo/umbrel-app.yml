  RWH4KS Public Pool (BCH Solo) is an ARM64-focused Umbrel app that runs a complete

  
  Bitcoin Cash solo-mining backend on a Raspberry Pi 4/5.
  

  It includes a pruned BCHN node, pool backend services, and a Stratum + API server.

  
  No external BCH node is required.

  
  Notice - Solo mining has high variance. You may mine for long

  
  periods without finding a block, even if everything is working correctly.
